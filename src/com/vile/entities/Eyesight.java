/**
 * Title: Eyesight
 * @author Alexander Byrd
 * Date Created: 7/4/2017
 * 
 * Description:
 * Carrying its own collision detection method. An eyesight entities
 * soul purpose is to move from an entity to its target, and will see
 * if it can see that target. Walls will block the entity from being
 * able to see the target, and this object will make sure it sends
 * back false in the case that it hits a wall and not the target.
 * 
 * Though this is an entity it is not a normal entity, and does not
 * exhibit many of the properties that other entities have. It only
 * has one main purpose. Therefore It does not extend entity.
