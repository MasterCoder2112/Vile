I added this to the resource packs for your opinon on what I should do 
about this in the future. I want to make it easier for people to manipulate
the enemies and their behavior without having to know coding at all. 
Obviously they can change the enemy textures but not their attributes at
the moment. My plan is to eventually have each entity in the game (including
corpses for smile) to have an attributes text file that will load in at the
start of the game so that the entities in game will have customized AI.
This will allow for people to cater the engine to whatever game they would
like to design. Here's an example of what attributes the files will have. If
an attribute is deleted from the file (when i add these) it will just add it back
after closing with the default setting returned to it so that the user cannot
completely destroy the enemy code. Also for projectile files, it will allow for
you to change their damage attributes and such as well.

CanFly: true or false. Can entity fly?
CanFire: true or false. Can entity fire projectiles?
CanResurrect: true or false. Can entity resurrect other entities?
Transparent: true or false. Is the enemy see through?
GhostLevel: 0, 1, or 2. 0 means it can't pass through anything. 1 is objects only. 2 is walls and objects.
Freindly: true or false. Is the enemy freindly to the player or not?
TargetItem: null or give the id of an item the entity will try to target
TargetEntity: null or true or false. Will target friendly entities or non-friendly depending on above setting
TargetPosition: null or give x and z coordinates of a position the entity will run to after being activated
PrimaryTarget: item, entity, or position. If this target is in sight, it will forget about any other targets and track this one
ProjectileType: 1-5. Type of projectile (if any) the enemy fires
Damage: 10. Damage entity does melee wise
Speed: 1. Speed of entity. 1 is normal, and reapers are 4. Any higher and you may get wierd results. 
Health: 100. Hit points of entity (health of entity)
Effects: Eventually entities might have special attack effects such as bleeding, burning, poisoning, etc...
SmartEnemy: true or false. Will entity track the target or just dumbly follow the targets position

Also items will have changable qualities too such as...

PickUpMessage: "You picked up the ----"
Solid: true or false. Is the object solid
CanBePickedUp: true or false. Some items can't be picked up
HealPoints: int value
ArmorPoints: int value
SpeedPoints: int value. Item that increases players overall speed
UpgradePoints: int value. Does item give any upgrade points to the player
AmmoType: int value. What weapon will this ammo (if any) will go to
AmmoAmount: int value
IfMutated: int value. If the item turns into a different item when picked up (like holy water turns into table) then put that value here. -1 if none

Also Weapons will have changable qualities in the future too such as...

WeaponRechargeTime: int value
Damage: int value
AmmoType: int value. What type of projectile does this shoot? Give its ID
MaxAmmo: int value. How much ammo weapon can hold
CartridgeSize: int value. How much ammo can cartridge hold
NumCartridges: How many cartridges can this weapon have
Spread: true or false. Spread shot like a shotgun or not?
Immediate: true or false. Will shot reach entity instantly, or need time to fly (like a rocket)
SmartAim: true or false. Will it be shot straight out of the cross hair (only do if its immediate, and not a spread) or not

And lastly, the HUD text should be changed to allow for a customized feel for the game. This will be especially useful as I
will no longer need to mess with SMILE. SMILE will just be a resource pack, not an actual game. This will be done sort of 
like the following, but I would like some feedback and maybe help from others on getting this stuff to work because all of this
listed on here will take a lot of time to get working and help would be nice.

WeaponOneCartridgesMessage: "Bullet cartridges: NUM WILL BE PUT HERE IN PROGRAM"
WeaponOneAmmoInCartridgeMessage: "Bullets in cartridge: NUM"
WeaponOneAmmo: "Bullets: NUM"
etc...
Health: "Health: NUM" or "Happiness: NUM" etc...
Armor: "Armor: NUM"
Keys: "Keys:"
Secrets: "Secrets Found: NUM"
Kills: "Kills: NUM"
Enemies: "Enemies: NUM" This is for survival mode mainly

Again any help or advice you can give would be greatly appreciated
